      <h2>Saturday 8th February '25 10:30am-1pm True North: A Workshop on Values and Authentic Livingy</h2>
      <p>Have you ever felt like something is missing in your life, even when everything seems fine on the surface? Perhaps you’re unsure about what truly drives you or whether the path you're on reflects who you really are.</p>
<p>In a fast-paced world filled with distractions and societal expectations, it’s easy to lose sight of what matters most — <strong>your core values.</strong> These values are the foundation of your identity, guiding your choices, relationships, and sense of fulfillment.</p>
<p>Join us for our new True Bonds Event "<em>True North"</em>, an interactive and personalized&nbsp;workshop designed and presented by George Vrakas to help you:<br><br>
✨ <strong>Uncover your core values</strong> – the principles that define who you are.<br>
✨ <strong>Gain clarity</strong> on what truly matters to you in life.<br>
✨ <strong>Learn practical tools</strong> to live authentically and make aligned decisions.<br>
✨ <strong>Connect with like-minded individuals</strong> on a similar journey of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Followed up with&nbsp;a delicious lunch and some fun games designed to strengthen our connections and help us dive even deeper into the new insights we've gained!</p>
